Black-Scholes Assumptions
 

There are a number of important assumptions to consider when viewing the formulae below. 

 

1) Interest rate is known and constant through time. 

2) The stock follows a random walk in continuous time, the variance of the stock price paths follow a log-normal distribution. 

3) Volatility is constant 

4) Stock pays no dividends (can be modified to include them however)

5) The option can only be exercised at expiration i.e. it is a European type option.

6) No transaction costs i.e. fees on shorting selling etc. 

7) Fractional trading is possible i.e. we can buy/sell 0.x of any given stock.
